# InsecureProgramming
 I originally crafted this exercises for raddy when he was 17? and
 wanted to learn what a buffer overflow was and how to exploit it. He
 showed me a few exercises he was doing and they were pretty poor, so
 we sat down and write some more, and then everytime he finished one,
 we wrote another. At the time, many people started doing them at Core
 SDI, among them was riq, who dreamed (really dreamed) a girl coming
 out of an oasis to tell hime a solution to what today is abo6.c, at
 the time it was abo5.c, so I had no other choice than write a new
 abo5.c. And the list kept growing.

 The last I wrote is the stack* series, as a sort of introduction to
 the subject. Starting with stack1.c I believe this comprises a self
 thought course on exploit writing with a good incremental rhythm.

 Of course as protection technologies and operating systems evolved,
 exploitation techniques changed, and what exercise can be exploited
 where has also changed, but I believe it's safe to assume all are
 exploitable on every operating system, because you'll be surprised of
 the solutions I've seen over time :-)

 Too many people told me they enjoyed playing and learning with "the
 abos", and many people also told me they are still using them, so,
 here they are... Who says they'll keep evolving?

 apparently doesn't exist anymore, nore I have anything to do with that
 company anymore (except its history)
